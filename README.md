# car_price
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of 426K used car listings to identify the key factors that influence car prices. Additionally, we aim to develop a predictive model that estimates used car prices based on these factors. The results will provide recommendations to a used car dealership regarding the influencing factors, helping them optimize pricing and inventory selection.

The dataset includes various attributes such as year, make, model, condition, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. To achieve this goal, we will perform a thorough data analysis to determine which factors have the strongest impact on price variation.

The tools and technologies that will be used in this project include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, and Statsmodels. The project will be developed using cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks/Google Colab and later hosted on GitHub for collaboration and version control.

As part of the CRISP-DM framework, key aspects of the Business Understanding phase that will be considered in this project include:

Requirements

Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values.
Feature engineering to create useful predictors.
Model training and evaluation
Assumptions

The actual data which can be assumed as historical data will be usedListeneintrag to predict future pricing trends.
Constraints

Missing or incomplete data may impact model accuracy.
External factors such as market trends and economic conditions are not included in the dataset.
Potential Risks

Poor data quality could negatively impact the accuracy of the models
Model overfitting may lead to poor generalization for new data
Strategies

Implement cross-validation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve model robustness.
Key Terminology

Regression Model
Feature Engineering.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
Outliers
One-hot Encoding
